## Retrospect
### challenges:
1. Communication was poor at the beginning and towards the end of the sprint 
1. not knowing other peoples progress on their story
1. There were too many submissions during the sprint
1. unplanned Load-shedding 

### Challenges mitigation plan
1. At least have a 15 minutes meeting everyday 
1. Time management and working consistently
1. plan around load-shedding schedule

### Things to continue doing:
1. plan user and developer stories together
1. continue knowledge sharing and helping each other.
1. Group memebers regularly push their stories on github 
1. continue submitting sprints every seven days
1. Base our sprint planning on previous sprint velocity

### For the next sprint we are aiming for a velocity of 24.
