## Retrospect
### challenges:
1. Communication was poor at the beginning and towards the end of the sprint 
1. not knowing other peoples progress on their story
1. stories time estimations were way too off
1. The stories were too large
1. There were many different libraries that need to be setup
1. unplanned Load-shedding 

### Challenges mitigation plan
1. At least have a 15 minutes meeting everyday 
1. Every group member should push the branch that they are working on to github so that we can see their progress.
1. use poker method for the stories time eastimation
1. make large stories an epic and break them into smaller stories
1. There will not be many libraries to setup in the following sprints
1. plan around load-shedding schedule

### Things to continue doing:
1. plan user and developer stories together
1. continue knowledge sharing and helping each other.

### For the next sprint we are aiming for a velocity of 31.
